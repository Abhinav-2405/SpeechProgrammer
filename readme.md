# Project Title

Speech Programmer


## Introduction

Speech Programmer is a web app which generates code from speech.The app currently supports only C code, and the user has to follow very specific rules when speaking.However, the progress I have made also works really well, and you can take a look at that from the video below. You could try out the application here(https://www.shreyasnisal.com/SpeechProgrammer/).
